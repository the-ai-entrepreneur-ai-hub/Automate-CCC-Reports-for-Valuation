# Automate CCC Reports for Valuation

**DEMONSTRATION ONLY - VISUAL WORKFLOW**

This repository demonstrates the automated valuation system workflow for processing CCC reports and generating accurate market valuations for insurance claims.

## System Workflow

flowchart TD
    A[Start Valuation Process] --> B[Load Configuration File<br>'valuation_config.txt']
    B --> C[Parse PER_MILE_RATE,<br>OPTION_ADJUSTMENTS,<br>IGNORE_VALUATION_BELOW]
    
    C --> D[Input Loss Vehicle Details:<br>VIN, Mileage, Options]
    D --> E[Input Comparable Vehicle Data:<br>List Price, Mileage, Options]

    E --> F{Source Valuation >= IGNORE_VALUATION_BELOW?}
    F -- No --> G[Discard as Unreliable Data]
    F -- Yes --> H[Process Comparable]
    
    subgraph H [Adjust Comparable Value]
        direction TB
        H1[Calculate Mileage Difference<br>Loss_Mileage - Comp_Mileage]
        H2[Apply Mileage Adjustment<br>Difference * PER_MILE_RATE]
        H3[For each option in comp...]
        H4{Option on Loss Vehicle?}
        H3 --> H4
        H4 -- No --> H5[Apply Adjustment from Config<br>e.g., +750 for 'Premium Package']
        H4 -- Yes --> H6[No Adjustment Needed]
        H2 & H5 & H6 --> H7[Sum All Adjustments]
        H8[Comp List Price] --> H9[Calculate Adjusted Value<br>List Price + Total Adjustments]
    end

    H --> I[Store Adjusted Value]
    G --> J[Next Comparable]
    I --> J
    
    J --> K{More Comparables?}
    K -- Yes --> E
    K -- No --> L[Calculate Final ACV<br>e.g., Average of All Adjusted Values]
    
    L --> M[Output Final Valuation Report]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Comparable Vehicle Sourcing
- **Multi-Source Scraping**: Automatically pulls data from CarFax, Edmunds, Autotrader, Cars.com
- **Built-in Fallbacks**: Continues working even if some sources are unavailable
- **Outlier Detection**: Flags statistical outliers for manual review
- **Damage Detection**: Identifies and flags listings with damage keywords

### 2. Configurable Adjustment Rules
The system uses a simple configuration file (`valuation_config.txt`) that can be easily modified:

```
PER_MILE_RATE=0.12
IGNORE_VALUATION_BELOW=5000
OPTION_ADJUSTMENTS={
    "Premium Package": 750,
    "Navigation System": 500,
    "Sunroof": 300,
    "Leather Seats": 400
}
```

### 3. Automated Processing Pipeline
1. **CCC Report Parsing**: Extracts vehicle details, VIN, mileage, and options
2. **Market Research**: Finds comparable vehicles from multiple sources
3. **Value Adjustments**: Applies mileage and option adjustments automatically
4. **Quality Control**: Filters unreliable data based on configurable thresholds
5. **Report Generation**: Creates professional Word/PDF reports

### 4. Real-World Example
**Case Study: 2007 BMW 335i (45k miles)**
- Insurance valuation: $8,431
- Market comps found: $12,500 - $16,500 range
- Automated adjustments for mileage and options
- Final ACV: Significantly higher than insurance estimate

## Development Timeline

- **Week 1**: CCC report parsing and data extraction
- **Week 2**: Comparable sourcing engine and adjustment logic
- **Week 3**: Report generation and user interface

*This is a demonstration repository showing the planned system workflow. The actual implementation will provide a drag-and-drop interface for processing CCC reports and generating market-based valuations.*
